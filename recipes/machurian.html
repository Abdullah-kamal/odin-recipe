            Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. <br>
            It may be prepared either by brewing coffee normally (i.e. carafe, French press, etc.) <br>
            and then serving it over ice or in cold milk or by brewing the coffee cold. <br>
            In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster. <br>
            Iced coffee can also be sweetened with pre-dissolved sugar in water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Iced coffee is regularly available in most coffee shops. Iced coffee is <br>
            generally brewed at a higher strength than normal coffee, given that it <br>
            is diluted by the melting ice. In Australia, "iced coffee" is a common term <br>
            for packaged coffee-flavored and sweetened milk beverage. <br>
            Iced coffee is made by brewing hot coffee, and pouring it over ice; <br>
            Cold brew coffee is made without heat by steeping coffee grounds into lukewarm water.
